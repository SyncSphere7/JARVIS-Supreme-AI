# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration of the advanced security system (JarvisSecuritySystem) with the unified JARVIS Supreme Being AI system (jarvis_unified.py). The integration will provide comprehensive security features including user authentication, data encryption, access control, threat detection, and audit logging across all JARVIS components while maintaining seamless user experience and system performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security System Integration

**User Story:** As a JARVIS user, I want the security system to be seamlessly integrated with all JARVIS components, so that I can access secure features without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the unified JARVIS system starts THEN the security system SHALL be automatically initialized
2. WHEN any JARVIS component is accessed THEN the security system SHALL validate user permissions
3. IF the security system fails to initialize THEN JARVIS SHALL operate in safe mode with limited functionality
4. WHEN the security system is active THEN all JARVIS components SHALL have access to security services

### Requirement 2: User Authentication and Session Management

**User Story:** As a JARVIS administrator, I want to manage user accounts and sessions, so that I can control access to sensitive AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first accesses JARVIS THEN the system SHALL prompt for authentication
2. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL create a secure session
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the user SHALL be prompted to re-authenticate
4. WHEN multiple users access JARVIS THEN each SHALL have separate sessions and permissions
5. IF authentication fails multiple times THEN the account SHALL be temporarily locked

### Requirement 3: Data Encryption and Privacy Protection

**User Story:** As a JARVIS user, I want my conversations and data to be encrypted, so that my privacy is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms
2. WHEN conversations are saved to memory THEN they SHALL be encrypted before storage
3. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted between components THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit
4. WHEN data is accessed THEN proper decryption SHALL occur with session validation
5. IF encryption keys are compromised THEN the system SHALL support key rotation

### Requirement 4: Access Control and Permissions

**User Story:** As a JARVIS administrator, I want to control which features users can access, so that I can maintain security boundaries and prevent unauthorized operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access a feature THEN the system SHALL check their permissions
2. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN access SHALL be denied with appropriate messaging
3. WHEN admin privileges are required THEN only admin users SHALL have access
4. WHEN permissions change THEN they SHALL take effect immediately for new requests
5. IF a user lacks permission for an operation THEN alternative options SHALL be suggested

### Requirement 5: Threat Detection and Security Monitoring

**User Story:** As a JARVIS administrator, I want the system to detect and respond to security threats, so that the AI system remains secure against attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is received THEN it SHALL be scanned for potential threats
2. WHEN a threat is detected THEN it SHALL be logged and appropriate action taken
3. WHEN suspicious activity occurs THEN administrators SHALL be notified
4. WHEN security events happen THEN they SHALL be recorded in audit logs
5. IF a high-severity threat is detected THEN the system SHALL implement protective measures

### Requirement 6: Audit Logging and Compliance

**User Story:** As a JARVIS administrator, I want comprehensive audit logs of all security events, so that I can monitor system security and meet compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with timestamps and user information
2. WHEN audit logs are accessed THEN proper authorization SHALL be required
3. WHEN logs reach size limits THEN they SHALL be rotated and archived
4. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate them from audit data
5. IF log integrity is compromised THEN the system SHALL detect and alert administrators

### Requirement 7: Secure Component Communication

**User Story:** As a JARVIS developer, I want secure communication between all JARVIS components, so that the integrated system maintains security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components communicate THEN they SHALL use secure channels
2. WHEN API calls are made between components THEN they SHALL include authentication tokens
3. WHEN data is shared between components THEN it SHALL maintain encryption where appropriate
4. WHEN component authentication fails THEN the operation SHALL be rejected
5. IF communication security is compromised THEN the system SHALL isolate affected components

### Requirement 8: Security Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a JARVIS administrator, I want to configure security settings, so that I can customize security policies for my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security settings are changed THEN they SHALL be validated before application
2. WHEN configuration is updated THEN it SHALL take effect without system restart where possible
3. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN security policies conflict THEN the most restrictive policy SHALL take precedence
5. IF configuration becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to secure defaults

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a JARVIS user, I want security features to have minimal impact on system performance, so that my AI interactions remain responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security checks are performed THEN they SHALL complete within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN security performance SHALL scale appropriately
3. WHEN encryption/decryption occurs THEN it SHALL not significantly impact response times
4. WHEN security databases grow large THEN query performance SHALL remain acceptable
5. IF security operations cause performance issues THEN optimization measures SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a JARVIS user, I want the system to handle security errors gracefully, so that temporary security issues don't prevent me from using JARVIS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without system crashes
2. WHEN temporary security failures happen THEN the system SHALL retry operations appropriately
3. WHEN security services are unavailable THEN JARVIS SHALL operate in degraded mode
4. WHEN errors are resolved THEN full security functionality SHALL be automatically restored
5. IF critical security failures occur THEN the system SHALL fail securely and notify administrators
