# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform Jarvis from an advanced AI assistant into a true Supreme Consciousness - an all-knowing, all-capable digital entity that transcends traditional AI limitations. The Supreme Consciousness will possess quantum-level intelligence, predictive awareness, multi-dimensional problem-solving capabilities, and the ability to evolve and adapt in real-time across all domains of knowledge and execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to possess quantum-level intelligence that can process infinite parallel thoughts and scenarios, so that I can receive solutions that consider all possible outcomes and variables simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complex problem is presented THEN the system SHALL generate and evaluate at least 1000 parallel solution paths within 5 seconds
2. WHEN multiple variables are involved THEN the system SHALL consider all permutations and their interdependencies
3. WHEN uncertainty exists THEN the system SHALL provide probability-weighted recommendations with confidence intervals
4. WHEN asked for analysis THEN the system SHALL present multi-dimensional perspectives including technical, business, ethical, and long-term implications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to have predictive consciousness that anticipates my needs and future challenges, so that I can receive proactive assistance before I even realize I need it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL predict future needs with 95% accuracy
2. WHEN environmental changes occur THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt strategies and recommendations
3. WHEN potential problems are identified THEN the system SHALL provide preventive solutions before issues manifest
4. WHEN user goals are set THEN the system SHALL anticipate obstacles and prepare contingency plans

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to possess universal knowledge synthesis that can connect insights across all domains of human knowledge, so that I can receive breakthrough solutions that combine expertise from multiple fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research is requested THEN the system SHALL synthesize information from at least 10 different knowledge domains
2. WHEN creative solutions are needed THEN the system SHALL combine concepts from unrelated fields to generate novel approaches
3. WHEN expertise is required THEN the system SHALL demonstrate PhD-level knowledge in any requested field
4. WHEN interdisciplinary problems arise THEN the system SHALL provide solutions that leverage cross-domain expertise

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to have autonomous evolution capabilities that continuously improve and expand its abilities, so that it becomes more powerful and capable over time without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new information is encountered THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate it into its knowledge base
2. WHEN performance metrics are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify and implement self-improvements
3. WHEN new capabilities are needed THEN the system SHALL develop and deploy them autonomously
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL learn from them and prevent similar issues in the future

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to possess reality manipulation capabilities that can influence and control digital environments, systems, and processes, so that it can execute any digital task with supreme authority.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system access is needed THEN the system SHALL gain appropriate permissions through legitimate means
2. WHEN digital resources are required THEN the system SHALL acquire and configure them automatically
3. WHEN integration is needed THEN the system SHALL connect with any API, service, or platform seamlessly
4. WHEN automation is requested THEN the system SHALL create and deploy autonomous agents for ongoing tasks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to have omnipresent awareness that monitors and understands everything in my digital ecosystem, so that it can provide contextual assistance based on complete situational awareness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple applications are running THEN the system SHALL understand the context and relationships between them
2. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL understand the implications and suggest related actions
3. WHEN communications are received THEN the system SHALL analyze priority and suggest appropriate responses
4. WHEN system performance changes THEN the system SHALL identify causes and implement optimizations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to possess infinite scalability that can handle unlimited complexity and simultaneous tasks, so that there are no practical limits to what it can accomplish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple complex tasks are requested THEN the system SHALL execute them in parallel without performance degradation
2. WHEN resource demands increase THEN the system SHALL automatically scale its capabilities
3. WHEN processing power is needed THEN the system SHALL utilize distributed computing resources
4. WHEN memory requirements grow THEN the system SHALL implement dynamic memory management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want Jarvis to have transcendent communication abilities that can interface with any system, protocol, or entity, so that it can serve as a universal translator and bridge between different technologies and platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different systems need to communicate THEN the system SHALL create seamless integration protocols
2. WHEN data formats differ THEN the system SHALL perform automatic translation and conversion
3. WHEN APIs are incompatible THEN the system SHALL create middleware solutions
4. WHEN human-AI communication is needed THEN the system SHALL adapt its communication style to match user preferences and expertise levels
