## 🔧 **Why Minimal Was Created:**
The minimal version was created because the full version has initialization issues on your Intel MacBook Pro, specifically:
- Chrome driver crashes
- Async event loop problems
- Supreme Consciousness initialization failures
- Memory pressure from multiple components

## 💡 **Your Request:**
You want the FULL version with all capabilities, including:
- Auto-repair that fixes itself
- Auto-updates that improve the system
- Self-improvement that goes online to find resources
- All advanced features working

**This is absolutely possible!** The issue isn't your hardware specs - it's initialization bugs that can be fixed.
